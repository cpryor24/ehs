            </div>
            <div class="collapsible-body white-text">
              <span>The primary purpose of behavior assistant services (BAS) is to provide support in implementing the BASP created by the behavior analysis services provider. The assistant must maintain a copy of the plan. This includes assisting the certified behavior analyst in assessing the recipient, assisting in implementing new procedures in the presence of the behavior analyst, acting as a model for correct implementation for the recipient or the caregivers, or coaching caregivers to implement the behavior program. Unlike other services, the behavior assistant provider’s focus is working with the caregivers to provide them with the skills to execute the procedures as detailed in the behavior analysis services plan, rather than the provision of intervention directly with the recipient and to evaluate a caregiver’s maintenance of skills needed for behavior program implementation.</span>

              <p>Behavior assistant services can only be provided under the supervision of a behavioral services provider. Supervision should include observation of the behavior assistant working with the recipient, their caregivers, or other providers. The behavior assistant must maintain documentation signed by the behavior analyst providing supervision. The behavior analyst can bill simultaneously for direct supervision of the behavior assistant.</p>

              <p>In the initial stages of treatment, the BAS provider can provide direct intervention with the recipient to help bring the identified behavior under control within a short period of time. However, thereafter, any direct intervention performed by the behavior assistant provider must be performed in the presence of caregivers and used as a training method. In circumstances where there is need for re-training of parents, training of new staff due to turnover, and the periodic need for new interventions, the behavior analysis provider may provide additional intervention and training to address the current need. If there are needs for extensive training and support, a request for an extension or renewal of the service may be submitted. In addition to training and systematically transferring the implementation of the plan to the caregivers, BAS also include monitoring of caregivers implementing the behavior plan, data collection, copying of forms and documents, maintenance of materials for data collection, and implementation of procedures, as well as communicating with the supervising behavioral services provider, in order to assist the behavior analysis services provider.

This service must be provided in direct relation to the achievement of the recipient’s goals as specified in the recipient’s support plan.

The provider assists with the acquisition, retention, or improvement of skills related to accessing and maintaining such employment, or developing and operating a small business. With the assistance of the provider, the recipient receives help in securing employment according to the recipient’s knowledge, skills, abilities, supports needed, desired goals, and planned outcomes. This service is conducted in a variety of settings, including work sites in which individuals without disabilities are employed. This service should include assisting a recipient to learn job tasks needed to be employed, and the recipient should be included in all aspects of job development, interviewing, and job seeking activities.</span></div>
